# ANN-Churn-Classification project

The ANN Churn Bank Project focuses on building a neural network model to predict customer churn for a banking dataset. By using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), I analyze various customer attributes to determine the likelihood of churn. The project involves preprocessing the data, feature engineering, and training the model to make accurate predictions.

To monitor and optimize the model, I utilize **TensorBoard** to visualize the training process, including metrics such as accuracy, loss, and other important performance indicators. This allows for better understanding and fine-tuning of the model.

Additionally, **Streamlit** is used to create an interactive web interface for the project. This interface enables users to input customer data and receive real-time churn predictions. The combination of TensorBoard for insights and Streamlit for user-friendly prediction makes the project comprehensive and accessible for decision-making.
